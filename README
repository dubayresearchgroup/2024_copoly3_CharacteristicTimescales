Simulation analysis code for the publication "Characteristic System Timescales Can Influence the 
Collective Sequence Development of Nematically Ordered Copolymers" (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.4c01047) 

The subdirectory "bond_reader" contains analysis code used in the calculation of the variables stored in
the pickle files in the "copoly_data" directory, as well as an example simulation script and associated output files. 
The full set of simulation data are not included due to size constraints, but are available from 
corresponding authors upon request.

The "copoly_data" directory contains pickle files with calculated variable of interest for each simulation
performed. These files are referenced in the Jupyter Notebook 'copoly3_Averaging_and_Plots.ipynb' 
for the creation of figures.

The subdirectory "Clustering" contains analysis code used in the HDBSCAN clustering analysis
and associated calculations and plots utilized in Section 3.4 of the publication.

The file 'MC_Calculation.ipynb' is a Jupyter Notebook containing the Monte Carlo calculation utilized
in Section 3.3 of the publication.

The subdirectory "activation_energy_calculation' contains the analysis code and sample data files used to perform
the calculation of observed activation energy for the reaction described in the SI for the publication.

The subdirectory "LAMMPSsrc" contains modified source files for LAMMPS version 7Aug19, which are required to run
the simulations performed in this work.
